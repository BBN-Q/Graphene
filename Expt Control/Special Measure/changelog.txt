02/16/08 Hendrik
Added cleanupfn call to smrun.
Reinstated log entries. Moved required functions (log*.m) 
from qDots/matlab to MATLAB/sm.

04/01/09 Hendrik
Syncronized channels directory with qDots/sm/channels
 - updated smadacinit.m  (previous version in smadacinitOld.m)
 - updated smcDecaDAC4.m, better error handling 
   (previous version in smcDecaDAC4old.m)
 - updated smcfeedback.m
 - deleted some .asv and .m~ files.

04/16/09 Hendrik
 - debuged trigger function of smcDecaDAC4.m
 - added trigger function to smcTDS5104.m
 - wrote smatrigfn.m as generic trigger function
 - updated smarampconfig.m to use generic trigger method by default

05/23/09 Hendrik
 - changed smcIPS12010GPIB.m to return peristent field if switch heater is off.
 - added 'SETP' channel to smcIPS12010GPIB.m  (may not be so useful and 
   subject to further change)
 - see qDots/matalb/ipscntrl.m for an auxiliary tool to change into and out of
   persistent mode.

06/09/09 Hendrik
 - changed x def for "loopless" data dimensions to a vector in smrun so that
   line plots get displayed properly.

06/29/09 Hendrik
 - added marker levels as channels to AWG520.

06/30/09 Hendrik
 - Added option to save only every nth iteration of saveloop.

07/13/09 Vivek
 - Moved the handling of 'setchanranges' field to after copying scan.loops into
   scandef.

08/02/09 Hendrik
 - Implemented more advanced processing function handling. New version still
  in qDots/matlab/smdev.m until proven stable.
 - New smcATS660v2.m, supporting continuous acquisition and providing 
   configuration and rearming functionality. To be considered a model for
   generic buffer support.

09/19/09 Hendrik
 - added samprate channel to smcATS660v2.m
 - tightened code for setting consts in smdev, changed smscan to scan there.
 - Wrote driver for Keithley2400 a while ago (with Thomas, may live on other
   computer)

09/24/09 Hendrik
- copied smdev.m to ygroup/qDots/MATLAB/sm/smrun.m
- supressed adding "sm_" to filename in smrun if filename contains "/".

10/24/09 Hendrik
- incorporated changes in MATLAB/sm into MATLAB/Special_Measure/sm

03/25/10 Hendrik
- changed smrun to set constants before calling configfn.
- wrote smabufconfig2 for generic configuration of buffered acquisition
- Vivek changed figure number for channel display.
- Improved smprintrange.
- Modified smcATS660v2.m to throw error for (some) invalid samplerates.

05/06/10 Hendrik
- implemented smrestore.m and sminc.m
- updated smpSpect[2].m
- improved buffered acquisition support by smcSR830
- added arming functionality to smatrigfn.m

05/13/10 Hendrik
- changed smrun to allow arguments to trafofn's.

06/01/10 Hendrik
- changed smset to expand ramprate if only single value given.

02/08/11 Hendrik
- Added pause feature to smrun - press space bar in data figure (typically 1000)
- Removed one check for scan interruption from smrun, moved other one to remove 
  redundant code.
- Added new feature for smrun to skip all but first sample of loops that do 
  nothing but setting ramps. Feature is enabled by negative ramptime.
- Implemented smsaveinst and smloadinst for ease of moving instruments
  from one rack and computer to another.
- Implemented very symple rountines smloadchans, smsavechans to 
  read and write all channels to/from file.
- Wrote new smcATS660v3.m with slightly increased performance.
